## What's this?

My personal collection of:

- ✨ Half-finished projects that "just need one more feature"
- 🚀 Over-engineered solutions to simple problems
- 💡 3 AM ideas that seemed brilliant at the time
- 🔥 Code that works but nobody knows why
- 📦 Experiments with every new framework I found on Twitter

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone this-mess
pnpm install --pray-it-works
pnpm run something
# 🤞 Cross your fingers
```

## Warning Labels

⚠️ **May contain traces of**: Stack Overflow copy-paste, energy drinks, and existential dread  
🔥 **Not recommended for**: Production, sanity, or your mental health  
💸 **Side effects**: AWS bills, imposter syndrome, and an urge to rewrite everything

## Hall of Shame

🏆 **Most Over-engineered**: Todo app with microservices  
🔥 **Biggest Disaster**: Auto-deploy script (we don't talk about it)  
🦄 **Most Useless**: Blockchain rock-paper-scissors ($50/game in gas fees)
